Axios Payments needed a system that could handle their explosive growth. Their legacy monolith was crumbling under the weight of 500 orders per minute.

## The Challenge
The primary challenge was ensuring **Data Consistency** while maintaining **High Availability**. A single lost transaction in a financial system is catastrophic.

## The Solution
We re-architected the entire system into 15 specialized microservices.

### Tech Stack
- **Languages**: Go (Golang)
- **Infrastructure**: AWS EKS (Kubernetes)
- **Database**: CockroachDB (for global consistency)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus & Grafana

## The Results
- **10k+ TPS** handled during peak sales.
- **99.99% Uptime** maintained over 6 months.
- **70% Reduction** in operational costs due to efficient resource scaling.
