Edge computing is no longer a luxury; it's a requirement for the next generation of real-time applications. As we move into 2026, the shift from centralized cloud providers to distributed edge clusters is accelerating.

### Why Edge Matters
1. **Ultra-Low Latency**: Processing data closer to the user reduces the round-trip time significantly.
2. **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Only relevant data is sent to the core cloud, saving costs and local bandwidth.
3. **Improved Privacy**: Sensitive data can be processed and scrubbed locally before ever leaving the device or local network.

At **Xinteck**, we are building the infrastructure that powers this transition. Our recent work with decentralized CDNs has shown a 40% improvement in load times for users in rural areas.
