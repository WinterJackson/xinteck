Scaling a fintech application to handle 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) requires more than just adding more servers. It requires a fundamental shift in how you handle state and consistency.

### The Architecture
We chose a **microservices architecture** using Go for its extreme efficiency and Kubernetes for its orchestration capabilities.

- **Storage**: We utilized a combination of PostgreSQL for relational data and Redis for high-speed caching of session data.
- **Messaging**: RabbitMQ was the backbone of our asynchronous processing, ensuring no transaction was lost even during peak traffic.

The result was a system that not only handled the target load but surpassed it, peaking at 14k TPS during stress testing.
